anjea [backup|vault|list|help]

  anjea_backup uses rsync to synchronize files.
  It uses hard links which are suitable for large sets of small, chaning files.
  Hard links are not so optimal for large files, a single changed byte
  will leed to a full copy of that file.

  Configuration takes place in two files, anjea.conf and backup.conf .
  The the README for details.
